    "A traditional database table will have a set number of columns, and each row in the table will have the same set of columns.  Different types of data are stored in different tables, and rows within a given table can not have different sets of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Neo4j (and in other \"NoSQL\" databases that use a record model rather than a relational table model), all things in the system are placed in a single \"Node\" database, and each can have any properties you want to assign to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, where a relational database might have separate tables for students and employees, for example, in Neo4j, students and employees are both stored as nodes, and the properties of the node are set as is appropriate for the type of node (so employees have name, age, and an employee ID - just like in the example table above - and students might have name, age, major, expected graduation date, and student ID).\n",

    "    - `( n )` tells the Cypher Query to filter and retrieve matches from all nodes.  In `MATCH`, the letter you place here is a name you'll use in subsequent parts of the query to refer to matching nodes (like the `AS` keyword in SQL).  It can be any name, does not need to be `n`.\n",
    "    - Simply placing a name here means it will look at all nodes, regardless of type/label.  To filter on a label, append the label after the name, separated by a colon.  So, for nodes of type \"Employee\", your `MATCH` would look something like: `MATCH ( employees : Employee )`\n",

    "- **Degree Centrality ** - counts the number of edges that an individual node has \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Nodes with a high degree of connections usually play an important role in a network\n",
    "    - This can also be looked at in aggregate for all nodes in a graph to get an idea of the overall connectedness of the graph.  For example, calculate the mean and median degree centrality across all nodes to look at how connected a graph is, in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Betweenness ** - indicator of a node's centality in a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Equal to the number of shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass through that node\n",
    "    - This also can be looked at in aggregate to characterize an entire network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diameter** - The longest shortest path over all pairs of nodes \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Often we want to find the shortest distance between two nodes; the diameter is the longest of these paths \n",
    "     - Nodes that occur on many shortest paths between other nodes in the graph have a high betweenness centrality score\n",
